                 My Dearest Madiha Tabassum 💖,
      Happy Birthday to the person who is not just my best friend,
      but one of the most beautiful chapters of my life 🎂✨
      I don’t know how to put everything into words,
      because our bond is not simple —
      it’s emotional, cute, crazy, comforting, and magical all at once 🫶
      Nuvvu na life lo ochina roju nundi,
      chaala vishyalu maripoyayi…
      smiles easy ga vachayi,
      badha unte share cheskovadam easy ayyindi,
      and silence kuda meaningful ayyindi 💫
      Tum sirf meri best friend nahi ho,
      tum meri safe place ho.
      Jab duniya thoda heavy lagti hai na,
      tumhari ek choti si baat bhi sab kuch halka kar deti hai 🥹
      Nee navvu chusthe,
      automatically heart calm avuthundi.

      We’ve shared laughs that still echo in my mind,
      moments that only we understand,
      and feelings that don’t need explanation.
      That’s rare. That’s precious. That’s us ✨
      Aaj nee birthday roju,

      all the happiness,
      and all the beautiful things this world can offer 💫
      No matter where life takes us,
      no matter how much time passes,
      our bond will always stay special.
      Because some connections are forever 💞
      Happy Birthday once again 🎉💖
      WITH LOVE 🤗
